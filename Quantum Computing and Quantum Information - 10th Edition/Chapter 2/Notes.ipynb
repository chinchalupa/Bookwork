    "## Vector Duals\n",
    "In quantum mechanics, there is the concept of the vector dual. Given a vector $\\mid v\\rangle$, we can write its complex conjugate as $\\langle v\\mid$. This is also often called the *outer product representation*.\n",

    "We can use vector duals to describe a linear operator from vector space $V$ to vector space $W$. This can be written as $\\mid w\\rangle\\langle v\\mid$. We can define this vector dual acting on vector $\\mid v'\\rangle$ as $(\\mid w\\rangle\\langle v\\mid)\\mid v'\\rangle$. Since linear operations are order independent, we can rewrite this equation as $\\mid w\\rangle\\langle v\\mid v'\\rangle$.\n",
